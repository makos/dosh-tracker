Dosh Tracker

WIP

A tool that allows you to record and track your spendings.
Requires Python 3.x, no other modules required.
See LICENSE for licensing.

For easier usage on Linux, make 'main.py' executable (`chmod +x main.py`) and do `./main.py`.
GUI is to come, hopefully.

Config file:
when running for first time, '.config' file is created in parent directory.
It's a JSON file that contains two settings - 'step' and 'calc_ratios'.

They can be edited via the Options feature from the program.

You can use your own config files, see './main.py -h' for details.
